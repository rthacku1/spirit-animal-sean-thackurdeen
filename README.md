# Spirit Animals
Author: R. Sean Thackurdeen

My spirit animal is a rabbit.

- Rabbits are cautious.
- Rabbits are soft.
- Rabbits are small.

Rabbits can be found in meadows, woodlands and wetlands, where they live in structures called burrows.

One can find more information about my spirit animal [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit).
